The operating results of Orbotech have been included in our Consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 from the Acquisition Date. For additional details, refer to Note 6 “Business Combinations” to our Consolidated Financial Statements. [2] On July 1, 2018, we adopted ASC 606 using the modified retrospective transition approach. Results for reporting periods beginning after June 30, 2018 are presented under ASC 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with the previous revenue guidance in ASC 605. [3] We had a net loss of $134.3 million in the second quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, primarily as a result of the income tax effects from the enacted tax reform legislation through the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was signed into law on December 22, 2017. [4] Basic and diluted net income (loss) per share are computed independently for each of the quarters presented based on the weighted-average basic and fully diluted shares outstanding for each quarter. Therefore, the sum of quarterly basic and diluted net income (loss) per share information may not equal annual basic and diluted net income (loss) per share."
