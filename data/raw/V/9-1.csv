0,[1],Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Earnings per share is calculated based on unrounded numbers. The number of shares and per share amounts for the prior periods presented have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the four-for-one stock split effected in the fiscal second quarter of 2015. See Note 14—Stockholders' Equity.
1,[2],"Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding are calculated on an as-converted basis, and include incremental common stock equivalents, as calculated under the treasury stock method. The computation includes 6 million, 7 million and 8 million common stock equivalents for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, because their effect would have been dilutive. The computation excludes 2 million of common stock equivalents for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 because their effect would have been anti-dilutive."
2,[3],The outstanding number of shares of class B and C common stock were not impacted by the stock split as these stockholders received an adjustment to their respective conversion ratios instead of stock dividends. See Note 14—Stockholders' Equity. Weighted-average basic and diluted shares outstanding for class B and C common stock are calculated based on the common shares outstanding of each respective class rather than on an as-converted basis.
