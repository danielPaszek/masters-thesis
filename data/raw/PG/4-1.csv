4,[5],"Diluted net earnings/(loss) per share in each quarter is computed using the weighted average number of shares outstanding during that quarter while Diluted net earnings/(loss) per share for the full year is computed using the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. In the quarter ended June 30, 2019, the Company reported a Net loss attributable to P&G, driven by the Shave Care impairment charges discussed in Note 4. This caused certain of our equity instruments to be antidilutive for the full year (preferred shares) and for the quarter ended June 30, 2019 (preferred shares and equity awards). Because these securities were dilutive during the first three quarters of this fiscal year, the sum of the four quarters' Diluted net earnings/(loss) per share will not equal the full-year Diluted net earnings per common share."
