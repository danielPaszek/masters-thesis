0,[1],"In the fourth quarter of 2010 we recorded a $52 million loss on the refranchising of our Mexico equity market as we sold all of our company owned restaurants, comprised of 222 KFCs and 123 Pizza Huts, to an existing Latin American franchise partner. The buyer will also serve as the master franchisee for Mexico which had 102 KFCs and 53 Pizza Hut franchise restaurants at the time of the transaction. The write off of goodwill included in this loss was minimal as our Mexico reporting unit includes an insignificant amount of goodwill. This loss did not result in any related income tax benefit and was not allocated to any segment for performance reporting purposes. During the year ended December 26, 2009 we recognized a non-cash $10 million refranchising loss as a result of our decision to offer to refranchise our KFC Taiwan equity market. During the year ended December 25, 2010 we refranchised all of our remaining company restaurants in Taiwan, which consisted of 124 KFCs. We included in our December 25, 2010 financial statements a non-cash write-off of $7 million of goodwill in determining the loss on refranchising of Taiwan. Neither of these losses resulted in a related income tax benefit, and neither loss was allocated to any segment for performance reporting purposes. The amount of goodwill write-off was based on the relative fair values of the Taiwan business disposed of and the portion of the business that was retained. The fair value of the business disposed of was determined by reference to the discounted value of the future cash flows expected to be generated by the restaurants and retained by the franchisee, which include a deduction for the anticipated royalties the franchisee will pay the Company associated with the franchise agreement entered into in connection with this refranchising transaction. The fair value of the Taiwan business retained consists of expected, net cash flows to be derived from royalties from franchisees, including the royalties associated with the franchise agreement entered into in connection with this refranchising transaction. We believe the terms of the franchise agreement entered into in connection with the Taiwan refranchising are substantially consistent with market. The remaining carrying value of goodwill related to our Taiwan business of $30 million, after the aforementioned write-off, was determined not to be impaired as the fair value of the Taiwan reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount.",,,,,
