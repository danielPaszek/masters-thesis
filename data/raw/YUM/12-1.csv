0,[1],"U.S. refranchising losses in the years ended December 31, 2011 and December 25, 2010 are primarily due to losses on sales of and offers to refranchise KFCs in the U.S. There were approximately 250 and 600 KFC restaurants offered for refranchising as of December 31, 2011 and December 25, 2010, respectively. While we did not yet believe these KFCs met the criteria to be classified as held for sale, we did, consistent with our historical practice, review the restaurants for impairment as a result of our offer to refranchise. We recorded impairment charges where we determined that the carrying value of restaurant groups to be sold was not recoverable based upon our estimate of expected refranchising proceeds and holding period cash flows anticipated while we continue to operate the restaurants as company units. For those restaurant groups deemed impaired, we wrote such restaurant groups down to our estimate of their fair values, which were based on the sales price we would expect to receive from a franchisee for each restaurant group. This fair value determination considered current market conditions, real-estate values, trends in the KFC U.S. business, prices for similar transactions in the restaurant industry and preliminary offers for the restaurant groups to date. The non-cash impairment charges that were recorded related to our offers to refranchise these company-operated KFC restaurants in the U.S. decreased depreciation expense versus what would have otherwise been recorded by $10 million and $9 million in the years ended December 31, 2011 and December 25, 2010, respectively. These depreciation reductions were not allocated to the U.S. segment resulting in depreciation expense in the U.S. segment results continuing to be recorded at the rate at which it was prior to the impairment charges being recorded for these restaurants. We will continue to review the restaurant groups for any further necessary impairment until the date they are sold. The aforementioned non-cash impairment charges do not include any allocation of the KFC reporting unit goodwill in the restaurant group carrying value. This additional non-cash write-down would be recorded, consistent with our historical policy, if the restaurant groups, or any subset of the restaurant groups, ultimately meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale. We will also be required to record a charge for the fair value of our guarantee of future lease payments for leases we assign to the franchisee upon any sale."
1,[2],"During the year ended December 31, 2011 we decided to refranchise or close all of our remaining Company-operated Pizza Hut restaurants in the UK market. While an asset group comprising approximately 350 dine-in restaurants did not meet the criteria for held-for-sale classification as of December 31, 2011, our- decision to sell was considered an impairment indicator. As such we reviewed this asset group for potential impairment and determined that its carrying value was not recoverable based upon our estimate of expected refranchising proceeds and holding period cash flows anticipated while we continue to operate the restaurants as company units. Accordingly, we wrote this asset group down to our estimate of its fair value, which is based on the sales price we would expect to receive from a buyer. This fair value determination considered current market conditions, trends in the Pizza Hut UK business, and prices for similar transactions in the restaurant industry and resulted in a non-cash pre-tax write-down of $74 million which was recorded to Refranchising (gain) loss. This impairment charge decreased depreciation expense versus what would have otherwise been recorded by $3 million in 2011. This depreciation reduction was not allocated to the YRI segment, resulting in depreciation expense in the YRI segment results continuing to be recorded at the rate at which it was prior to the impairment charges being recorded for these restaurants. We will continue to review the asset group for any further necessary impairment until the date it is sold. The write-down does not include any allocation of the Pizza Hut UK reporting unit goodwill in the asset group carrying value. This additional non-cash write-down would be recorded, consistent with our historical policy, if the asset group ultimately meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale. Upon the ultimate sale of the restaurants, depending on the form of the transaction, we could also be required to record a charge for the fair value of any guarantee of future lease payments for any leases we assign to a franchisee and for the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment associated with Pizza Hut UK. The decision to refranchise or close all remaining Pizza Hut restaurants in the UK was considered to be a goodwill impairment indicator. We determined that the fair value of our Pizza Hut UK reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and as such there was no impairment of the approximately $100 million in goodwill attributable to the reporting unit."
2,[3],"During the year ended December 26, 2009 we recognized a non-cash $10 million refranchising loss as a result of our decision to offer to refranchise our KFC Taiwan equity market. During the year ended December 25, 2010 we refranchised all of our remaining company restaurants in Taiwan, which consisted of 124 KFCs. We included in our December 25, 2010 financial statements a non-cash write-off of $7 million of goodwill in determining the loss on refranchising of Taiwan. Neither of these losses resulted in a related income tax benefit. The amount of goodwill write-off was based on the relative fair values of the Taiwan business disposed of and the portion of the business that was retained. The fair value of the business disposed of was determined by reference to the discounted value of the future cash flows expected to be generated by the restaurants and retained by the franchisee, which include a deduction for the anticipated royalties the franchisee will pay the Company associated with the franchise agreement entered into in connection with this refranchising transaction. The fair value of the Taiwan business retained consists of expected, net cash flows to be derived from royalties from franchisees, including the royalties associated with the franchise agreement entered into in connection with this refranchising transaction. We believe the terms of the franchise agreement entered into in connection with the Taiwan refranchising are substantially consistent with market. The remaining carrying value of goodwill related to our Taiwan business of $30 million, after the aforementioned write-off, was determined not to be impaired as the fair value of the Taiwan reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount."
3,[4],"In the year ended December 25, 2010 we recorded a $52 million loss on the refranchising of our Mexico equity market as we sold all of our Company-owned restaurants, comprised of 222 KFCs and 123 Pizza Huts, to an existing Latin American franchise partner. The buyer is serving as the master franchisee for Mexico which had 102 KFC and 53 Pizza Hut franchise restaurants at the time of the transaction. The write-off of goodwill included in this loss was minimal as our Mexico reporting unit included an insignificant amount of goodwill. This loss did not result in any related income tax benefit."
