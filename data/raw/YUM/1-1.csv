(c)Our operating results reflect revenues from and expenses to support the Russian operations for Pizza Hut, prior to the date of transfer, and KFC, for the entirety of the year ended December 31, 2022 (see Note 3) within their historical financial statement line items and operating segments. However, given our decision to exit Russia and our pledge to direct any future net profits attributable to Russia subsequent to the date of invasion to humanitarian efforts, we have reclassed such net operating profits from the Division segment results in which they were earned to Unallocated Other income (expense). As a result, we reclassed net operating profits of $44 million from KFC and Pizza Hut Division Other income (expense) to Unallocated Other income (expense) during the year ended December 31, 2022. Also, included in Unallocated Other income (expense) were $13 million in foreign exchange gains attributable to fluctuations in the value of the Russian ruble. Additionally, we recorded charges of $7 million to Corporate and unallocated G&A expenses and $6 million to Unallocated Franchise and property expenses during the year ended December 31, 2022 for certain expenses related to the transfer of the businesses and other one-time costs related to our exit from Russia."
