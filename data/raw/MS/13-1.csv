1,[2],"Interest income and expense are recorded within the consolidated statements of income depending on the nature of the instrument and related market conventions. When interest is included as a component of the instrument's fair value, interest is included within Principal transactions—Trading revenues or Principal transactions—Investment revenues. Otherwise, it is included within Interest income or Interest expense."
2,[3],"The Company considers its principal trading, investment banking, commissions, and interest income, along with the associated interest expense, as one integrated activity, and therefore, prior to December 2008, was unable to further breakout Interest income and Interest expense (see Note 1)."
3,[4],Certain reclassifications have been made to prior-period amounts to conform to the current year's presentation.
4,[5],"Amounts for 2010 included a loss of $1.2 billion related to the planned disposition of Revel included within the Institutional Securities business segment, a gain of $775 million related to the legal settlement with DFS and a gain of approximately $570 million related to the Company's sale of Retail Asset Management within the Asset Management business segment. Amounts for 2009 and fiscal 2008 included net gains of $499 million and $1,463 million, respectively, related to MSCI secondary offerings within the Institutional Securities business segment."
5,[6],See Note 1 for a discussion of discontinued operations.
6,[7],"Income from continuing operations for the Institutional Securities business segment included correction of prior-period errors of $171 million ($120 million after-tax), $0.11 per diluted share, due to the reversal of valuation adjustments related to interest rate derivatives and a cumulative negative adjustment of $120 million ($84 million after-tax), $0.08 per diluted share, resulting from incorrect valuations of a London-based trader's positions. The positive adjustment of $171 million related to fiscal 2006. The negative adjustment of $120 million increased income from continuing operations on a pre-tax basis by $45 million and $75 million in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2008, respectively. The Company does not believe the adjustments, which were recorded in the period identified, were material to those consolidated financial statements after considering both the quantitative amount and qualitative factors as related to the affected financial statements."
