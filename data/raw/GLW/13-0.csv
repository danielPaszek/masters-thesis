In 2009, Corning recorded charges of $20 million to adjust the asbestos liability for the change in value of certain components of the amended PCC Plan and the estimated liability for non-PCC asbestos claims. In 2008, Corning reduced its liability for asbestos litigation by $327 million as a result of the increase in the likelihood of a settlement under recently proposed terms and a corresponding decrease in the likelihood of a settlement under terms established in 2003. Also, in 2008, Corning recorded a credit of $13 million to adjust the asbestos liability for the change in value of certain components of the Amended PCC Plan. (4) Other corporate items include the tax impact of the unallocated amounts and the following significant items: • In 2010, Corning recorded a loss of $30 million ($19 million after tax) from the repurchase of $126 million principal amount of our 6.2% senior unsecured notes due March 15, 2016 and $100 million principal amount of our 5.9% senior unsecured notes due March 15, 2014. • In 2009, Corning recorded $10 million of additional valuation allowance due to a change in judgment about the realizability of U.S. and United Kingdom deferred tax assets in future years; a $41 million tax benefit to reflect a deferred tax asset associated with Medicare Part D subsidies; a $27 million U.S. tax credit for research and experimentation expenses incurred from 2005 to 2008; and $98 million of restructuring charges. • In 2008, Corning released $2.5 billion of valuation allowances including $2.4 billion due to sustained profitability and positive future earnings projections for U.S. entities and $115 million from a change in estimate regarding 2008 U.S. taxable income.
