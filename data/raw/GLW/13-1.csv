In 2009, Corning recorded charges of $20 million to adjust the asbestos liability for the change in value of certain components of the amended PCC Plan and the estimated liability for non-PCC asbestos claims. In 2008, Corning reduced its liability for asbestos litigation by $327 million as a result of the increase in the likelihood of a settlement under recently proposed terms and a corresponding decrease in the likelihood of a settlement under terms established in 2003. Also, in 2008, Corning recorded a credit of $13 million to adjust the asbestos liability for the change in value of certain components of the Amended PCC Plan.
