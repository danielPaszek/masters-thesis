In the fourth quarter of 2013, we recognized a benefit of $3 in cost of equipment rentals, excluding depreciation related to our provision for self-insurance reserves.  [2]  During the fourth quarter of 2012, we recognized $13 of charges associated with the RSC acquisition. Additionally, during the quarter, we recognized restructuring charges of $6, primarily reflecting branch closure charges associated with the RSC acquisition. During the quarter, we also recognized asset impairment charges of $2 which are primarily reflected in non-rental depreciation and amortization and principally relate to write-offs of leasehold improvements and other fixed assets. During the fourth quarter of 2012, we redeemed our 10 7/8 percent Senior Notes and all of our outstanding 1 7/8 percent Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes were converted.
