[3]  From the beginning of our cost-reduction and productivity initiatives in 2005 through December 31, 2011, Employee termination costs represent the expected reduction of the workforce by approximately 57,400 employees, mainly in manufacturing and sales and research, of which approximately 42,800 employees have been terminated as of December 31, 2011. Employee termination costs are generally recorded when the actions are probable and estimable and include accrued severance benefits, pension and postretirement benefits, many of which may be paid out during periods after termination. Asset impairments primarily include charges to write down property, plant and equipment to fair value. Other primarily includes costs to exit certain assets and activities.

[4]  2010 vs. 2009 - The decrease in the domestic loss was due to revenues from legacy Wyeth products and a reduction in domestic restructuring charges partially offset by increased amortization charges primarily related to identifiable intangibles in connection with our acquisition of Wyeth and litigation charges primarily related to our wholly owned subsidiary Quigley Company, Inc. The decrease in international income was due primarily to an increase in international restructuring and amortization charges plus the non-recurrence of the gain in 2009 in connection with the formation of ViiV, partially offset by revenues from legacy Wyeth products.  [5]  Income from continuing operations before provision for taxes on income.  [6]  2011 vs. 2010 - The decrease in the domestic loss was primarily due to the non-recurrence of a charge of $1.3 billion (pre-tax) in 2010 for asbestos litigation related to our wholly owned subsidiary, Quigley Company, Inc., partially offset by a reduction in revenues due to the loss of exclusivity for several biopharmaceutical products and the impact of the U.S. Healthcare Legislation. The increase in international income was due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange, higher impairment charges in 2010, as well as increased revenues from the biopharmaceutical products such as the Prevnar/Prevenar franchise, Enbrel and Celebrex.
